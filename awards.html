                    The prestigious Great Place to Work Institute assessed us as a 
                    ‘Great Place to Work’ after NalandaWay came out with flying colours 
                    in their standard anonymous employee survey. The intent of it is to 
                    investigate the perceptions of employees and assess what their 
                    real-time experience is working at an organization. The rigorous 
                    survey involved our employees rating us across credibility, respect, 
                    fairness, pride and camaraderie.

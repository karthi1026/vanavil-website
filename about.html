                    Unicef has been the reason many of our marginalized children groups have taken to the arts for expression and ways to explore means of livelihood. In the last few years, this friendship has begun to have an enriching effect on the physical and mental wellbeing of adolescents. A huge thank you, Unicef, for walking with us right from the start!

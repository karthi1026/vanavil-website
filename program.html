                <p>Most women from the Nomadic Communities seek alms in places of worship and large gatherings due to
                    poverty and lack of viable livelihoods for them. They also tend to see it as a continuation of their
                    traditional soothsaying and taking grains in return. The Covid19 pandemic hit them most as the
                    lockdown meant no gatherings or worship. In order to ensure food security of the children and adults
                    we With the the support of Ashwini Seetha Foundation we started running SHGs to give interest free
                    loans to make these women into small vendors. Since they have amazing people skills sales works for
                    them. We have given Milch cows to single women and Tailoring training including power machine
                    training to younger women. </p>
